    Definition

        The Inhibit project is a tool to prevent accidental execution of
        critical commands, e.g. to shutdown or reboot the system by prompting
        the user to enter its hostname.

    Usage

        Now, to e.g. prevent the accidental execution of the 'shutdown',
        'poweroff', 'halt' and 'reboot' commands, add the following lines
        either to '/etc/bashrc' (system wide) or '~/.bashrc' (for the current
        user, only).

        In the following examples 'inhibit.sh' is located in '/opt/inhibit'.

            # Prevent certain commands to shutdown the system in any way
            alias halt='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh halt'
            alias poweroff='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh poweroff'
            alias reboot='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh reboot'
            alias shutdown='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh shutdown'

        You can also give command-line arguments for the inhibited command,
        for example:

            alias poweroff='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh poweroff -f'

        It is also possible to also inhibit commands for services controlled
        by 'systemctl'.

            alias systemctl='/opt/inhibit/inhibit.sh systemctl'

        Notice that this alias will have no effect unless you explicitly add
        the name of the service (or services) which should be confirmed to the
        service list inside 'inhibit.conf'. Details can be found inside that
        file.

        After adding the preferred aliases, you can apply the changes either
        by logging out and in again or by reloading the '.bashrc' file of the
        current user (depending on in which file you have added the aliases).

            $ source ~/.bashrc

        Now, if you want to execute one of those commands for which you have
        set up (created aliases for) Inhibit, you will explicitly have to
        confirm their execution.
