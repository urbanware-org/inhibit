This directory contains different headers that can be used as a custom header text. You can find the corresponding 'header' option inside the 'inhibit.conf' file. In case no header is set, Inhibit will use the default one.

All those headers were created using FIGlet. For an overwiew of the FIGlet fonts, you may have a look at the ASCII Figlet Generator by AskApache (https://www.askapache.com/online-tools/figlet-ascii).

Included header text files:

    File:   inhibit_blocks.txt
    Font:   banner3 (replaced hash character '#' with UTF-8 block element 'â–ˆ')

    File:   inhibit_blocks_frame.txt
    Font:   banner3 (same as 'inhibit_blocks.txt' with UTF-8 character frame)

    File:   inhibit_default.txt

    File:   inhibit_legacy.txt (default header from version 1.2.0)
