    Email address

        Any suggestions, questions, bugs to report or feedback to give?

        You can contact me by sending an email to <dev@urbanware.org>.

        Due to the fact, that my projects are spare time projects, the email
        account is not being checked for mails regularly, but usually at least
        once a week.

    General questions

        Do not hesitate to ask. If you have any questions about this project
        and its components or need help using them, just leave me a message.

    Bug reports

        There are two ways to send me a bug report. Either via email or by
        opening a GitHub issue (I would prefer that if you have a GitHub
        account).

        Before sending in a bug report, please get the latest version of the
        corresponding project first to check if that bug has been fixed
        already. So, do not report bugs for any older or modified version.

        Please add detailed information about the issue, e.g. the exact error
        message, in which case it appears, which commands have been used and
        (if possible) how to reproduce it.

        However, there is no support for any third-party components such as
        external modules or applications.
